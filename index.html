		You were locked in the asylum because you belived you could breathe fire. 
		<br /> To excape from this madhouse you will have to kill nurses, janitors, and fellow psychopaths to find the key to the exit. 
		<br /> The farthest left bar is your health meter. If you run out of health, you lose.
		<br /> The next bar is your rage meter. Keep it 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow to maximize attack damage.
		<br /> If your rage meter fills all the way up, you lose what is left of your mind. You lose the game.
		<br /> If your rage meter goes down to zero you become complacent and lose your will to escape. You lose the game.
		<br /> The furthest right bar is your Magic meter. Maybe it does somthing.
		<br /> Use the arrow keys to navigate the map. Walk into the same square as an enemy to do battle.
		<br />
		<br /> I want to be honest and stop working on my game at 48 hours. 
		<br /> So I am uploading this game with the bug that after using an attack, you can't see the effects of it.
